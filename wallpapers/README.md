I like my wallpaper to be very subtle because it annoys me, when I can't read the text due to a *fancy* wallpaper. This wallpaper is all black with a little texture and a vignette.

I use it on all may devices, because I love using the same wallpaper on every device. On smaller devices, I just center it.
